## 🔥 About Me

I’m a passionate Full-Stack Developer with a deep interest in backend systems, scalable architecture, and modern web development.
I enjoy transforming ideas into real applications—whether personal projects, hackathons, or experimental prototypes.

I’ve built several frontend, backend, and full-stack applications using technologies like React, Next.js, Tailwind, SCSS, Java Spring Boot, Node.js, and a wide range of modern databases including MySQL, MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and Firebase and many more.

I’ve also worked with modern tools and services such as Clerk Auth, Kinde Auth, Convex, Plunk/Resend email, and various UI libraries like shadcn/ui.
Currently, I’m expanding my expertise in backend engineering, cloud (AWS), automation with Jenkins, and starting to contribute in Open Source.

I love learning, exploring, and improving—every single day.
